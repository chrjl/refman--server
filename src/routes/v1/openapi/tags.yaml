/tags/{tag}:
  post:
    summary: Perform operations on a specific keyword.
    description: |
      Operation details are to be supplied by header parameters. Data can be sent in request body.

      Supported operations:

      - Rename an existing keyword, emulating the WebDAV `MOVE` method. The new name of the keyword is passed to the `Destination` header.

        ```sql
        UPDATE OR REPLACE keywords
        SET
            keyword = {tag}
        WHERE
            keyword = {Destination}
        ```

        The new name does not have to be unique. A keyword can be renamed such that its associated items are absorbed by an already existing keyword.

        ---

      > **Note:**
      > Duplicate (`itemKey`, `keyword`) entries are avoided via the `UNIQUE INDEX` constraint.
